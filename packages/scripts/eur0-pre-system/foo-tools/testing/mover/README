This is a mover tool, to keep free space on your HDs.

It is only useful if you have the following setup:

* One 'incoming' partition.  (You have to make seperate .conf files
  if you have more incoming files).

* Multiple archive partitions where you want to copy the stuff to.


Look at the sample mover.conf for example configurations.

Also, (like the rest of the tools here) this tool WILL delete files
on your drives, so use with extreme care - you have been warned !
