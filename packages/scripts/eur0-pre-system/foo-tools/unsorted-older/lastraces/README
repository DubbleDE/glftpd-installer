This is a tool to view last races which a user has participated in.

1) Edit lastraces.c at the top.. change 'default' dirs to fit the setup.

2) Change SKIPREGEX to be a valid regex for all dirs that should be skipped.

3) Change ROOTDIR to be the rootdir for glftpd files.

4) Copy lastraces binary to <glftpd-dir>/bin, and add it to glftpd.conf

5) If you installed it as 'site races' then login and do:
   'site races myusername'
