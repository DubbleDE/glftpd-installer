This is a very quick kicker to prevent people from dual-leeching on your
site.  I know glftpd has this feature, but this tool allows you to
define a private path in which users are allowed to dual leech (this is
good eg. for groups spreading release from private dir).  Also, it adds
an log entry to glftpd.log, which you can make your bot create fancy
output from.

The glftpd.log format is as follows:

KICK: "DUAL" "<username>" <otherpid> "<otherfile>" <thispid> "<thisfile>"

Try dual-leeching to get a log-entry created, and then figure how to use
it with your botscript.


Installing:

* Edit Makefile, you MUST set the IPCKEY to the ipckey used in the setup.

* Edit antidualleech.c and update the list of people who are allowed
  to dual-leech.

* Run 'make' to build binary.

* Run 'make install' to put the file to FTPROOT/bin/ with correct perms.

  If you do not have FTPROOT setup, then:

  cp foo-antidualleech /glftpd/bin
  chown root.root /glftpd/bin/foo-antidualleech
  chmod 4711 /glftpd/bin/foo-antidualleech

  It needs these permissions, or it will not be able to send kill to
  other glftpd sessions !


* Add cscript to /etc/glftpd.conf:
	cscript RETR /bin/foo-antidualleech
