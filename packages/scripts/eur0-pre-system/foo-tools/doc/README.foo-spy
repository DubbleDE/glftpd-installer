If you dont have your glftpd.conf in /etc/glftpd.conf, then
you must start the tool as 'spy /path/to/my.conf'.

Also, the bug usurper pointed out; Someone must be logged
into the ftp before you start the spy. It doesnt create
the shared memory by itself.

Quick usage:

UP/DOWN - move cursor
'k'     - if root, then kick the user.
'd'     - switch to dir-mode, view the dir the user is in.
'u'     - switch back to user-mode from dir-mode.
