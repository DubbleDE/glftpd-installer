The sfv tools contains two programs, which will be very
quickly described here:



blehsfv:
--------
This is a sfv checker.  It will read a .sfv file and check files
from current dir against it.  Optionally it will take an argument
if you do only wish to get one file sfv checked.

/path/to/blehsfv
    checks all files in *.sfv of a dir.

/path/to/blehsfv myfile.rar
    checks myfile.rar against *.sfv of the dir.



createsfv:
----------
This is a tool to create a sfv file entry for a file.  It takes
one argument, which is the filename to create sfv entry from.

/path/to/createsfv myfile.rar
    creates sfv entry for myfile.rar

An example of how this could be used in a script:

-- myleetsfvcreator.sh --
#!/bin/sh

echo "; created by myleetsfvcreator" > $1

for rarfile in *.r??; do 

	echo `/path/to/createsfv $rarfile` >> $1

done

--

You could then call it like:

cd /path/to/rarfiles
/path/to/myleetsfvcreator.sh myfiles.sfv

.. which would create myfiles.sfv with the entries of the *.r??
of /path/to/rarfiles
