This package contains the foo-nukes tool.

Once it is build, copy foo-nukes to glftpd/bin, and add
it to the .conf.

It is supposed to be a replacement too for 'site nukes'.
Run 'site nukes help' after it is installed for help.

NOTE: You probably want to change NUKES_SITEROOT to "/site" in
nukes.h!
